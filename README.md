# horiseon_refactor
hw assignment #1


This project the the first assigment. We are tasked with refactoring code that made up a single-paged website. More specifically, our tasks are as follows:
            GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
            WHEN I view the source code
            THEN I find semantic HTML elements
            WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
            THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
            WHEN I view the image elements
            THEN I find accessible alt attributes
            WHEN I view the heading attributes
            THEN they fall in sequential order
            WHEN I view the title element
            THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Correcting and consolidating code that was given to us is the main goal. This project will test our knowledge of HTML and CSS syntax and format. The final product should resemble the example provided to us.

Relevant files on this repo should include, an html file, css file, and images needed for the site. 

This is an individual assignemnt
